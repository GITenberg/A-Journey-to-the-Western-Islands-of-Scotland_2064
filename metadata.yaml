description: "A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775) is a travel narrative\
  \ by Samuel Johnson about an eighty-three-day journey through Scotland, in particular\
  \ the islands of the Hebrides, in the late summer and autumn of 1773. The sixty-three-year-old\
  \ Johnson was accompanied by his thirty-two-year-old friend of many years James\
  \ Boswell, who was also keeping a record of the trip, published in 1785 as A Journal\
  \ of a Tour to the Hebrides. The two narratives are often published as a single\
  \ volume, which is beneficial for comparing two perspectives of the same events,\
  \ although they are very different in approach---Johnson focused on Scotland, and\
  \ Boswell focused on Johnson. (Boswell went on to write a famous biography of Johnson.)\n\
